# Project Euler Solutions
## General
These are by no means the best or most efficient solutions.
Some of these solutions need a long run-time to get to the solution (most of them don't though)
## Python
The python branch makes use of [nayuki's eulerlib.py](https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions/blob/master/python/eulerlib.py).
## Golang
I did not make a seperate github repository for my own eulerlib for Golang. Therefor the folder "eulerlib" needs to be downloaded and put into "C:\Program Files\Go\src\github.com\t1sk3". If this folder does not exist, you can create it. \
The first 30 problems do not make use of this package as it was created after completing these.
## C#
Although the algorithms are right and the scripts get the right results, these files might not be the most elegant as I am still trying to learn C# using Project Euler for practice.
