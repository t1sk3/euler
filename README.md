# Project Euler Solutions
## General
These are by no means the best or most efficient solutions.
Some of these solutions need a long run-time to get to the solution
## Python
The python branch makes use of nayuki's eulerlib.py as well as the eulerlib library for python
## Golang
I did not make a seperate github repository for my own eulerlib for Golang. Therefor the folder needs to be downloaded and put into "C:\Program Files\Go\src".
